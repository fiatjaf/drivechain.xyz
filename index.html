      A mechanism defined by <a href="https://bips.xyz/300">BIP300</a> that
      allows people to send money to specific sidechain "buckets" on the
      mainchain, and then block producers to vote over a long period of 3~6
      months to authorize withdrawals back from that bucket. There is also

      A mechanism that allows a sidechain to anchor itself on the Bitcoin chain
      (therefore not needing any proof-of-work of its own) while also pushing
      the sum of all its block fees into a single Bitcoin transaction that can
      be earned by Bitcoin block producers without them even knowing. It can be
      implemented using either

<p>
  Drivechain is the technique for the creation of
  <b>decentralized 2-way peg sidechains</b> for Bitcoin. These sidechains can be
  used to improve Bitcoin in every front, including
  <a href="#privacy">privacy</a>, <a href="#scalability">scalability</a>,
  <a href="#decentralization">decentralization</a> and
  <a href="#security">security</a>, and also add many interesting features not
  possible before that can make the world better and continue the revolution
  started by Satoshi Nakamoto.

  <div style="width: 100%">
    <h2>How does Drivechain improve...</h2>

    <ul>
      <li id="privacy">
        <b>Privacy</b>: by making it quick and cheap to use Zcash, Mimblewimble
        and Monero-like sidechains, Bitcoin users have their privacy instantly
        improved without the need for costly and cumbersome and barely effective
        coinjoin methods.
      </li>
      <li id="scalability">
        <b>Scalability</b>: Sidechains can scale Bitcoin horizontally. Even
        without any new features, just by copying the Bitcoin code multiple
        times its scale is multiplied, and without burdening the main chain.
        This is sharding done right. <br />
        It's also possible to take proven scalability technologies invented
        elsewhere (client-side validation, zk-rollups, Lightning-like networks
        or a mix of all these) and apply them to Bitcoin directly through
        sidechains.
      </li>
      <li id="decentralization">
        <b>Decentralization</b>: By using sidechains for scalability and
        features we can keep the Bitcoin chain small and lightweight, and maybe
        even reduce its block size. And then users of either combination of
        sidechains can choose the sidechain they want to run alongside the very
        small Bitcoin mainchain.
      </li>
      <li id="security">
        <b>Security</b>: By turning all block fees from a sidechain into a
        single transaction with a ton of fees to the Bitcoin miners, hashrate is
        increased, mining is more decentralized the Bitcoin chain is more
        secure. It's the solution to the unsolved problem of the shrinking block
        reward.
      </li>
      <li id="innovation">
        <b>Innovation</b>: So far we have only seen innovations in the
        blockchain space done by literal scammers. Once there is an environment
        in which honest and smart people can operate we will probably be
        surprised about the new things that will show up.

    <h2>Possible Sidechains</h2>

    <p>
      A list of some good candidates of things that can be enabled as sidechains
      once BIP300 is activated on Bitcoin.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://bitcoinhivemind.com/">Hivemind</a>, decentralized
        prediction markets that will revolutionize the emergence and diffusion
        of knowledge in society by making cheap talk expensive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Namecoin</b>, or some other form of blockchain for names, so we can
        do with ICANN what Bitcoin is doing to Central Banks (<a
          href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/bitnames/"
          >an idea of what that could look like</a
        >).
      </li>

        <a

        or
        <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/d036511015caea5a28514259a1bab119"
          >zkCoins</a
        >, two proposals for highly-scalable money transfer systems, powered by
        client-side validation, that only require a blockchain for very
        lightweight double-spend prevention, but not for storing any long-term
        data or global state.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/zside-meltcast/">zSide</a>,
        Zcash fork that is already running as a sidechain on Drivenet to finally
        solve Bitcoin privacy problems. Also comes with decentralized and
        user-friendly melt/cast function.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.rsk.co/">RSK</a>, Ethereum-compatible federated
        sidechain that already exists but wants to turn itself into a
        drivechain. Can be used as the hotbed of new ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Monero</b>, some people prefer this one, it has some real-world usage
        already and is even displacing Bitcoin in many darknet places.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/thunder/">Thunder</a>, a
        reasonable proposal for large-block sidechains for scaling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>, despite some weird shitcoining
        mixed in (that can be discarded), it's a simple design (a blockchain
        market for contracts and reputation) that solves a real problem (storing
        files) and apparently has proven to work over the years.
